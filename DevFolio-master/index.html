                <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                  "FarmGuide" is a web application system that was created to
                  overcome the issues that still exist in the use of manual
                  systems. The difficulties faced by farmers or any other common
                  people who want to start farming. Based on the information the
                  user submits to the program (such as the type of farming, the
                  location, the availability of water, etc.), the application
                  helps the user determine the type of farming they can engage
                  in. Based on user inputs, the application will produce a list
                  of every potential proposal. The program is kept as simple as
                  possible to reduce data entry errors. Each farm has unique
                  requirements. Therefore, we provide specialised equipment
                  sales systems that are required for farming. We also have an
                  online store where we sell crucial farming supplies including
                  pesticides, fertiliser, seeds, and other equipment and
                  supplies that are essential for farming. Since the project is
                  being created at the administrative end, access is only
                  guaranteed to the administrative firm or organisation. The
                  initiative supplies all resources necessary to start farming,
                  whether it be in rural or urban areas, and attempts to develop
                  an application programme to assist individuals in knowing what
                  form of farming they may start.

                    </h4>In this phase, it will convert the text into speech. Whatever the input maybe it will convert the text using NLP techniques and Py audio.<h4>Color detection :
                    </h4>In this phase, it tries to detect the color of the object which has been shown in front of the camera. It mainly detects the main colors which have been in common.

              <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                This project was done in cooperation with a corporate bank, which supplied the necessary
data resources. The project aimed to see whether the cooperating corporate bank used
heuristic credit rating models. Validation of credit ratings is complex compared to regular
modeling, where no actual or observed rating can be compared with the predicted credit
rating to measure the prediction error. Some validation methods are available, but no
single measure can be used to decide whether one model is better than the other. It is thus
necessary to consider numerous measures simultaneously to draw some conclusions on
model performance. This has a clear disadvantage as it might be debatable whether one
model is better. In order to address this problem, an attempt was made to combine the
available measures into a single measure. As missing values are frequently apparent in
many modeling variables, some thoughts are made on how to solve that problem. The
problem regarding a small sample of data is dealt with. The general purpose of this
project is to see how it is possible to construct credit rating models. Particular emphasis is
made on the practical methods a bank in the corporate banking sector
could use to develop a new credit rating model.
